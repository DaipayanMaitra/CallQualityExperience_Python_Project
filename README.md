# Voice Call Quality Customer Experience Analysis

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Indian Voice Call Quality Customer Experience dataset, utilizing Python for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization, as well as Power BI for creating an insightful dashboard.

## Project Description
A comprehensive analysis of Indian Voice Call Quality Customer Experience data using Python and Power BI to uncover insights on call quality, network performance, and customer experience.

## Project Structure
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical, and merging monthly datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Performing summary statistics, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing.
- **Data Analysis:**
  - Identifying the best-rated operator in each state.
  - Analyzing the correlation between network type and rating.
  - Investigating the association between call drops and environment (indoor/outdoor).
- **Data Visualization:** Creating visualizations to represent key metrics and insights using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Using Power BI to create a dashboard that visualizes key findings and metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Key Findings
1. **Best Rated Operator:** Identified the best-rated telecom operator in each state overall and in terms of indoor, outdoor, and traveling environments.
2. **Correlation Analysis:** Found a positive but weak correlation between network type and rating.
3. **Call Drops Analysis:** Determined that call drops are significantly associated with the environment, with indoor environments experiencing more call drops.
4. **Network Performance:** Analyzed the performance of different network types (2G, 3G, 4G) in terms of customer ratings.
5. **State-wise Performance:** Identified top and bottom states in terms of call quality ratings.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python:** Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization (using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy).
- **Power BI:** Dashboard creation for visualizing key metrics and insights.
